#### Using the install script:
```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/automoto/diff-check/master/scripts/get-diff-check.sh
# you're welcome to examine the script, it just grabs the latest release from github for your OS and installs it
sh get-diff-check.sh
```

If you already have an updated version of go lang, installing via go is easy:
`go get -u github.com/automoto/diff-check/`
